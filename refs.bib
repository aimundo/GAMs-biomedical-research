Abstract = {{. We study the coverage properties of Bayesian confidence intervals for
   the smooth component functions of generalized additive models (GAMs)
   represented using any penalized regression spline approach. The
   intervals are the usual generalization of the intervals first proposed
   by Wahba and Silverman in 1983 and 1985, respectively, to the GAM
   component context. We present simulation evidence showing these
   intervals have close to nominal across-the-function frequentist coverage
   probabilities, except when the truth is close to a straight line/plane
   function. We extend the argument introduced by Nychka in 1988 for
   univariate smoothing splines to explain these results. The theoretical
   argument suggests that close to nominal coverage probabilities can be
   achieved, provided that heavy oversmoothing is avoided, so that the bias
   is not too large a proportion of the sampling variability. The
   theoretical results allow us to derive alternative intervals from a
   purely frequentist point of view, and to explain the impact that the
   neglect of smoothing parameter variability has on confidence interval
   performance. They also suggest switching the target of inference for
   component-wise intervals away from smooth components in the space of the
   GAM identifiability constraints.}},

 abstract = {Models for the analysis of longitudinal data must recognize the relationship between serial observations on the same unit. Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) has been used in murine studies
   to quantify tumor perfusion and therapeutic response. These studies
   frequently use inhaled isoflurane anesthesia, which depresses the
   respiration rate and results in the desaturation of arterial oxygen
   saturation, potentially affecting tissue physiological parameters.
   However, there have been no controlled studies quantifying the effect of
   isoflurane anesthesia on DRS-derived physiological parameters of murine
   tissue. The goal of this study was to perform DRS on Balb/c mouse (n =
   10) tissue under various anesthesia conditions to quantify effects on
   tissue physiological parameters, including total hemoglobin
   concentration, tissue oxygen saturation, oxyhemoglobin and reduced
   scattering coefficient. Two independent variables were manipulated
   including metabolic gas type (pure oxygen vs. medical air) and
   isoflurane concentration (1.5 to 4.0\%). The 1.5\% isoflurane and 1
   L/min oxygen condition most closely mimicked a no-anesthesia condition
   with oxyhemoglobin concentration within 89\% +/- 19\% of control. The
   time-dependent effects of isoflurane anesthesia were tested, revealing
   that anesthetic induction with 4.0\% isoflurane can affect DRS-derived
   physiological parameters up to 20 minutes post-induction. Finally,
   spectroscopy with and without isoflurane anesthesia was compared for
   colon tumor Balb/c-CT26 allografts (n = 5) as a representative model of
   subcutaneous murine tumor allografts. Overall, isoflurane anesthesia
   yielded experimentally-induced depressed oxyhemoglobin, and this
   depression was both concentration and time dependent. Investigators
   should understand the dynamic effects of isoflurane on tissue
   physiological parameters measured by DRS. These results may guide
   investigators in eliminating, limiting, or managing anesthesia-induced
   physiological changes in DRS studies in mouse models. (C) 2018 Optical

Abstract = {{Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent
   in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not
   seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the
   generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using
   LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the
   standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical
   arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best
   when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the
   design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven
   random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and
   sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples
   when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power
   advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs
   used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where
   subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental
   manipulations always generalize worse than separate F-1 and F-2 tests,
   and in many cases, even worse than F-1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be
   the `gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in
   psycholinguistics and beyond. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Applied researchers often find themselves making statistical inferences

   We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections.
   Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear
   entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We
   propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple
   comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting
   estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically
   keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple
   comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting
   the p values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus,
   multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also
   yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low
   group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a
   particular concern.}},

Title = {{Errors in statistical inference under model misspecification: evidence,
   hypothesis testing, and AIC}},
Journal = {{Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{The methods for making statistical inferences in scientific analysis
   have diversified even within the frequentist branch of statistics, but
   comparison has been elusive. We approximate analytically and numerically
   the performance of Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing, Fisher
   significance testing, information criteria, and evidential statistics
   (Royall, 1997). This last approach is implemented in the form of
   evidence functions: statistics for comparing two models by estimating,
   based on data, their relative distance to the generating process (i.e.,
   truth) (Lele, 2004). A consequence of this definition is the salient
   property that the probabilities of misleading or weak evidence, error
   probabilities analogous to Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis
   testing, all approach 0 as sample size increases. Our comparison of
   these approaches focuses primarily on the frequency with which errors
   are made, both when models are correctly specified, and when they are
   misspecified, but also considers ease of interpretation. The error rates
   in evidential analysis all decrease to 0 as sample size increases even
   under model misspecification. Neyman-Pearson testing on the other hand,
   exhibits great difficulties under misspecification. The real Type 1 and
   Type 2 error rates can be less, equal to, or greater than the nominal
   rates depending on the nature of model misspecification. Under some
   reasonable circumstances, the probability of Type 1 error is an
   increasing function of sample size that can even approach 1! In
   contrast, under model misspecification an evidential analysis retains
   the desirable properties of always having a greater probability of
   selecting the best model over an inferior one and of having the
   probability of selecting the best model increase monotonically with
   sample size. We show that the evidence function concept fulfills the
   seeming objectives of model selection in ecology, both in a statistical
   as well as scientific sense, and that evidence functions are intuitive
   and easily grasped. We find that consistent information criteria are
   evidence functions but the MSE minimizing (or efficient) information
   criteria (e.g., AIC, AICc, TIC) are not. The error properties of the MSE
   minimizing criteria switch between those of evidence functions and those
   of Neyman-Pearson tests depending on models being compared.}},

A generalization of the analysis of variance is given for these models using log-likelihoods. These generalized linear models are illustrated by examples relating to four distributions; the Normal, Binomial (probit analysis, etc.), Poisson (contingency tables) and gamma (variance components). The implications of the approach in designing statistics courses are discussed.},

Abstract = {{Social scientists almost always use statistical models positing the
   dependent variable as a global, linear function of X, despite suspicions
   that the social and political world is not so simple, or that our
   theories are so strong. Generalized additive models (GAMs) let
   researchers fit each independent variable with arbitrary nonparametric
   functions, but subject to the constraint that the nonparametric effects
   combine additively. In this way GAMs strike a sensible balance between
   the flexibility of nonparametric techniques and the ease of
   interpretation and familiarity of linear regression. GAMs thus offer
   social scientists a practical methodology for improving on the extant
   practice of global linearity by default.
   We reanalyze published work from several subfields of political science,
   highlighting the strengths (and limitations) of GAMs. We estimate
   non-linear marginal effects in a regression analysis of incumbent
   reelection, nonparametric duration dependence in an analysis of cabinet
   duration, and within-dyad interaction effects in a reconsideration of
   the democratic peace hypothesis. We conclude with a more general
   consideration of the circumstances in which GAMs are likely to be of use
   to political scientists, as well as some apparent limitations of the
   technique.}},

Title = {{Using a generalized additive model with autoregressive terms to study
   the effects of daily temperature on mortality}},
Journal = {{BMC Medical Research Methodology}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Generalized Additive Model (GAM) provides a flexible and
   effective technique for modelling nonlinear time-series in studies of
   the health effects of environmental factors. However, GAM assumes that
   errors are mutually independent, while time series can be correlated in
   adjacent time points. Here, a GAM with Autoregressive terms (GAMAR) is
   introduced to fill this gap.
   Methods: Parameters in GAMAR are estimated by maximum partial likelihood
   using modified Newton's method, and the difference between GAM and GAMAR
   is demonstrated using two simulation studies and a real data example.
   GAMM is also compared to GAMAR in simulation study 1.
   Results: In the simulation studies, the bias of the mean estimates from
   GAM and GAMAR are similar but GAMAR has better coverage and smaller
   relative error. While the results from GAMM are similar to GAMAR, the
   estimation procedure of GAMM is much slower than GAMAR. In the case
   study, the Pearson residuals from the GAM are correlated, while those
   from GAMAR are quite close to white noise. In addition, the estimates of
   the temperature effects are different between GAM and GAMAR.
   Conclusions: GAMAR incorporates both explanatory variables and AR terms
   so it can quantify the nonlinear impact of environmental factors on
   health outcome as well as the serial correlation between the
   observations. It can be a useful tool in environmental epidemiological
   studies.}},

Splines are presented as a nonparametric function estimating technique. After a general introduction to the theory of interpolating and smoothing splines, splines are treated in the nonparametric regression setting. The method of cross-validation for choosing the smoothing parameter is discussed and the general multivariate regression/surface estimation problem is addressed. An extensive discussion of splines as nonparametric density estimators is followed by a discussion of their role in time series analysis. A comparison of the spline and isotonic regression methodologies leads to a formulation of a hybrid estimator. The closing section provides a brief overall summary and formulates a number of open/unsolved problems relating to splines in statistics. }

Abstract = {{This article discusses a general framework for smoothing parameter
   estimation for models with regular likelihoods constructed in terms of
   unknown smooth functions of covariates. Gaussian random effects and
   parametric terms may also be present. By construction the method is
   numerically stable and convergent, and enables smoothing parameter
   uncertainty to be quantified. The latter enables us to fix a well known
   problem with AIC for such models, thereby improving the range of model
   selection tools available. The smooth functions are represented by
   reduced rank spline like smoothers, with associated quadratic penalties
   measuring function smoothness. Model estimation is by penalized
   likelihood maximization, where the smoothing parameters controlling the
   extent of penalization are estimated by Laplace approximate marginal
   likelihood. The methods cover, for example, generalized additive models
   for nonexponential family responses (e.g., beta, ordered categorical,
   scaled t distribution, negative binomial and Tweedie distributions),
   generalized additive models for location scale and shape (e.g., two
   stage zero inflation models, and Gaussian location scale models), Cox
   proportional hazards models and multivariate additive models. The
   framework reduces the implementation of new model classes to the coding
   of some standard derivatives of the log-likelihood. Supplementary
   materials for this article are available online.}},

    abstract = { Abstract Generalized additive models have the form η(x) = α + σ fj (x j ), where η might be the regression function in a multiple regression or the logistic transformation of the posterior probability Pr(y = 1 | x) in a logistic regression. In fact, these models generalize the whole family of generalized linear models η(x) = β′x, where η(x) = g(μ(x)) is some transformation of the regression function. We use the local scoring algorithm to estimate the functions fj (xj ) nonparametrically, using a scatterplot smoother as a building block. We demonstrate the models in two different analyses: a nonparametric analysis of covariance and a logistic regression. The procedure can be used as a diagnostic tool for identifying parametric transformations of the covariates in a standard linear analysis. A variety of inferential tools have been developed to aid the analyst in assessing the relevance and significance of the estimated functions: these include confidence curves, degrees of freedom estimates, and approximate hypothesis tests. The local scoring algorithm is analogous to the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm for solving likelihood and nonlinear regression equations. At each iteration, an adjusted dependent variable is formed and an additive regression model is fit using the backfitting algorithm. The backfitting algorithm cycles through the variables and estimates each coordinated function by smoothing the partial residuals. }

Title = {Beyond Repeated-Measures Analysis of Variance Advanced Statistical
   Methods for the Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Anesthesia Research},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Research in the field of anesthesiology
   relies heavily on longitudinal designs for answering questions about
   long-term efficacy and safety of various anesthetic and pain regimens.
   Yet, anesthesiology research is lagging in the use of advanced
   statistical methods for analyzing longitudinal data. The goal of this
   article was to increase awareness of the advantages of modern
   statistical methods and promote their use in anesthesia research.
   Methods: Here we introduce 2 modern and advanced statistical methods for
   analyzing longitudinal data: the generalized estimating equations (GEE)
   and mixed-effects models (MEM). These methods were compared with the
   conventional repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) through a
   clinical example with 2 types of end points (continuous and binary). In
   addition, we compared GEE and MEM to RM-ANOVA through a simulation study
   with varying sample sizes, varying number of repeated measures, and
   scenarios with and without missing data.
   Results: In the clinical study, the 3 methods are found to be similar in
   terms of statistical estimation, whereas the parameter interpretations
   are somewhat different. The simulation study shows that the methods of
   GEE and MEM are more efficient in that they are able to achieve higher
   power with smaller sample size or lower number of repeated measurements
   in both complete and missing data scenarios.
   Conclusions: Based on their advantages over RM-ANOVA, GEE and MEM should
   be strongly considered for the analysis of longitudinal data. In
   particular, GEE should be used to explore overall average effects, and
   MEM should be used when subject-specific effects (in addition to overall
   average effects) are of primary interest.}},

Pages = {{213-234}},
Abstract = {{For handling missing data, newer methods such as those based on multiple
   imputation are generally more accurate than older ones and entail weaker
   assumptions. Yet most do assume that data are missing at random (MAR).
   The issue of assessing whether the MAR assumption holds to begin with
   has been largely ignored. In fact, no way to directly test MAR is
   available. We propose an alternate assumption, MAR+, that can be tested.
   MAR+ always implies MAR, so inability to reject MAR+ bodes well for MAR.
   In contrast, MAR implies MAR+ not universally, but under certain
   conditions that are often plausible; thus, rejection of MAR+ can raise
   suspicions about MAR. Our approach is applicable mainly to studies that
   are not longitudinal. We present five illustrative medical examples, in
   most of which it turns out that MAR+ fails. There are limits to the
   ability of sophisticated statistical methods to correct for missing
   data. Efforts to try to prevent missing data in the first place should
   therefore receive more attention in medical studies than they have
   heretofore attracted. If MAR+ is found to fail for a study whose data
   have already been gathered, extra caution may need to be exercised in
   the interpretation of the results.}},

Abstract = {{Using standard missing data taxonomy, due to Rubin and co-workers, and
   simple algebraic derivations, it is argued that some simple but commonly
   used methods to handle incomplete longitudinal clinical trial data, such
   as complete case analyses and methods based on last observation carried
   forward, require restrictive assumptions and stand on a weaker
   theoretical foundation than likelihood-based methods developed under the
   missing at random (MAR) framework. Given the availability of flexible
   software for analyzing longitudinal sequences of unequal length,
   implementation of likelihood-based MAR analyses is not limited by
   computational considerations. While such analyses are valid under the
   comparatively weak assumption of MAR, the possibility of data missing
   not at random (MNAR) is difficult to rule out. It is argued, however,
   that MNAR analyses are, themselves, surrounded with problems and
   therefore, rather than ignoring MNAR analyses altogether or blindly
   shifting to them, their optimal place is within sensitivity analysis.
   The concepts developed here are illustrated using data from three
   clinical trials, where it is shown that the analysis method may have an
   impact on the conclusions of the study.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of violations of the sphericity assumption
   on Type I error rates for different methodical approaches of repeated
   measures analysis using a simulation approach. In contrast to previous
   simulation studies on this topic, up to nine measurement occasions were
   considered. Effects of the level of inter-correlations between
   measurement occasions on Type I error rates were considered for the
   first time. Two populations with non-violation of the sphericity
   assumption, one with uncorrelated measurement occasions and one with
   moderately correlated measurement occasions, were generated. One
   population with violation of the sphericity assumption combines
   uncorrelated with highly correlated measurement occasions. A second
   population with violation of the sphericity assumption combines
   moderately correlated and highly correlated measurement occasions. From
   these four populations without any between-group effect or
   within-subject effect 5,000 random samples were drawn. Finally, the mean
   Type I error rates for Multilevel linear models (MLM) with an
   unstructured covariance matrix (MLM-UN), MLM with compound-symmetry
   (MLM-CS) and for repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) models
   (without correction, with Greenhouse-Geisser-correction, and
   Huynh-Feldt-correction) were computed. To examine the effect of both the
   sample size and the number of measurement occasions, sample sizes of n =
   20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 were considered as well as measurement occasions
   of m = 3, 6, and 9. With respect to rANOVA, the results plead for a use
   of rANOVA with Huynh-Feldt-correction, especially when the sphericity
   assumption is violated, the sample size is rather small and the number
   of measurement occasions is large. For MLM-UN, the results illustrate a
   massive progressive bias for small sample sizes (n = 20) and m = 6 or
   more measurement occasions. This effect could not be found in previous
   simulation studies with a smaller number of measurement occasions. The
   proportionality of bias and number of measurement occasions should be
   considered when MLM-UN is used. The good news is that this
   proportionality can be compensated by means of large sample sizes.
   Accordingly, MLM-UN can be recommended even for small sample sizes for
   about three measurement occasions and for large sample sizes for about
   nine measurement occasions.}},

abstract = {The mixed model in a 2-way analysis of variance is characterized by a fixed classification, e.g., treatments, and a random classification, e.g., plots or individuals. If we consider $k$ different treatments each applied to everyone of $n$ individuals, and assume the usual analysis of variance assumptions of uncorrelated errors, equal variances and normality, an appropriate analysis for the set of $nk$ observations $x_{ij}, i = 1, 2, \cdots n, j = 1, 2, \cdots k$, is ???? where the $F$ ratio under the null hypothesis has the $F$ distribution with $(k - 1)$ and $(k - 1)(n - 1)$ degrees of freedom. As is well known, if we extend the situation so that the errors have equal correlations instead of being uncorrelated, the $F$ ratio has the same distribution. Under the null hypothesis, the numerator estimates the same quantity as the denominator, namely, $(1 - \rho)\sigma^2$, where $\rho$ is the constant correlation coefficient among the treatments. This case can also be considered as a sampling of $n$ vectors (individuals) from a $k$-variate normal population with variance-covariance matrix $$V = \sigma^2 \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \rho & \cdots & \rho \\ \rho & & & \vdots \\ \vdots & & & \rho \\ \rho & \cdots & \rho & 1\end{pmatrix}.$$ If we consider this type of formulation and suppose the $k$ treatment errors to have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix (the same for each individual), then the usual test described above is valid for $k = 2$. For $k > 2$, and $n \geqq k$, Hotelling's $T^2$ is the appropriate test for the homogeneity of the treatment means. However, the working statistician is sometimes confronted with the case where $k > n$, or he does not have the adequate means for computing large order inverse matrices and would therefore like to use the original test ratio which in general does not have the requisite $F$ distribution. Box [1] and [2] has given an approximate distribution of the test ratio to be $F\lbrack(k - 1)\epsilon, (k - 1)(n - 1)\epsilon\rbrack$ where $\epsilon$ is a function of the population variances and covariances and may further be approximated by the sample variances and covariances. We show in Section 3 that $\epsilon \geqq (k - 1)^{-1}$, and therefore a conservative test would be $F(1, n - 1)$. Box referred only to one group of $n$ individuals. We shall extend his results to a frequently occurring case, namely, the analysis of $g$ groups where the $\alpha$th group has $n_\alpha$ individuals, $\alpha = 1, 2, \cdots g$, and $\Sigma^g_{\alpha = 1} n_\alpha = N$. We will show that the treatment mean square and the treatment $\times$ group interaction can be tested in the same approximate fashion by using the Box procedure.},

 abstract = {This article provides a unified discussion of a useful collection of heterogeneous covariance structures for repeated-measures data. The collection includes heterogeneous versions of the compound symmetry and first-order autoregressive structures, the Huynh-Feldt structure, the independent-increments structure, correlated random coefficients models, the first-order antedependence model, and a simplified factor-analytic construction. These structures significantly broaden the arsenal of covariance models available to statistical researchers for accounting for and explaining variability. The structures have a simple and interpretable parameterization which is well-suited for likelihood-based estimation, testing, and selection, and they are easily fit with commercial software. Two examples are used to illustrate the following advantages of considering this class of heterogeneous covariance structures: (1) Parameter interpretability is retained by avoiding transformations. (2) The choice between the traditional univariate and multivariate approaches, involving "parsimony means power," is generalized, thus enabling more accurate inferences on mean-model parameters. (3) Alternatives to and connections with the "empirical sandwich" estimator are provided. (4) Scientific discovery is enhanced.},

Abstract = {{Analyzing ecological data often requires modeling the autocorrelation
   created by spatial and temporal processes. Many seemingly disparate
   statistical methods used to account for autocorrelation can be expressed
   as regression models that include basis functions. Basis functions also
   enable ecologists to modify a wide range of existing ecological models
   in order to account for autocorrelation, which can improve inference and
   predictive accuracy. Furthermore, understanding the properties of basis
   functions is essential for evaluating the fit of spatial or time-series
   models, detecting a hidden form of collinearity, and analyzing large
   data sets. We present important concepts and properties related to basis
   functions and illustrate several tools and techniques ecologists can use
   when modeling autocorrelation in ecological data.}},

Abstract = {{Radiotherapy-related dermatological toxicities over time have not been
   well quantified. We examined during and immediately following radiation
   therapy skin toxicities over time in a randomized study of mometasone
   furoate vs placebo during breast radiotherapy.
   Patients with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy to the breast or
   chest wall were randomized. Symptoms related to skin toxicity were
   addressed weekly using provider-reported Common Terminology Criteria for
   Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0) and 4 patient-reported outcomes (PRO)
   surveys. We applied repeated measures and risk analysis methodologies.
   One hundred seventy-six patients were enrolled. By CTCAE, significant
   differences favoring mometasone were detected over time in all
   toxicities except skin striae, atrophy, and infection. Statistically
   significant differences between arms at baseline but not over time
   occurred for all Linear Analog Self-Assessment. Statistically
   significant differences occurred for all symptoms in the temporal
   profile of symptoms as measured by PRO surveys (all P < .001).
   The use of longitudinal methods enhanced the ability of PRO tools to
   detect differences between study arms. Our results strengthened the
   conclusions of the original report that mometasone reduced acute skin
   toxicities. PRO surveys can accurately assess patients' experiences of
   symptom type and intensity over time and should be included in future
   clinical trials.
   For radiotherapy-related dermatological toxicity, we hypothesized that
   clinically significant differences over time, if any, can be found by
   repeated measures. We examined the acute skin toxicities in a randomized
   study of mometasone vs placebo during breast radiotherapy. For secondary
   end points, we showed that longitudinal methods enhanced the detection
   of differences between study arms and strengthened the conclusions from
   the original report. Frequent patient-reported outcome surveys over time
   should be included in future clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{Mouse monoclonal antibody A33 (mAb A33) recognizes a M-r 43,000 cell
   surface glycoprotein (designated A33) expressed in human colonic
   epithelium and colon cancer but absent from most other normal tissues.
   In patients, mAb A33 localizes with high specificity to colon cancer and
   is retained for up to 6 weeks in the cancer but cleared rapidly from
   normal colon (5-6 days). As a carrier of I-125 or I-131, mAb A33 has
   shown antitumor activity. Induction of strong human anti-mouse antibody
   (immunoglobulin; HAMA) responses in patients, however, limits the use of
   the murine mAb A33 to very few injections. A humanized version of this
   antibody (huAb A33) has been prepared for Phase I and II clinical
   studies in patients with colon cancer. In those studies, immunogenicity
   of huAb A33 has been monitored using a novel, highly sensitive BIACORE
   method, which allows measurement of human anti-human antibodies (HAHAs)
   without the use of secondary reagents. We found that 63\% (26 of 41) of
   the patients treated with repeated doses of huAb A33 developed HAHAs
   against a conformational antigenic determinant located in the V-L and
   V-H regions of huAb A33. Detailed serological analysis showed two
   distinct types of HAHAs. HARA of type I (49\% of patients) was
   characterized by an early onset with peak HARA levels after 2 weeks of
   treatment, which declined with ongoing huAb A33 treatment. HAHA of type
   Il (17\% of patients) was characterized by a typically later onset of
   HAHA than in type I and by progressively increasing HAHA levels with
   each subsequent huAb A33 administration. Colon cancer patients with type
   I HAHAs did not develop infusion-related adverse events. In contrast,
   HARA of type II was indicative of infusion-related adverse events. By
   using this new method, we were able to distinguish these two types of
   HAHAs in patients while on antibody treatment, allowing patients to be
   removed from study prior to the onset of severe infusion-related adverse
   events.}},

Title = {{Mouth opening in patients irradiated for head and neck cancer: A
   prospective repeated measures study}},
Journal = {{Oral Oncology}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{548-555}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Aims of this prospective cohort study were (1) to analyze
   the course of mouth opening up to 48 months post-radiotherapy (RT), (2)
   to assess risk factors predicting decrease in mouth opening, and (3) to
   develop a multivariable prediction model for change in mouth opening in
   a large sample of patients irradiated for head and neck cancer.
   Materials and methods: Mouth opening was measured prior to RT (baseline)
   and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months post-RT. The primary outcome
   variable was mouth opening. Potential risk factors were entered into a
   linear mixed model analysis (manual backward-stepwise elimination) to
   create a multivariable prediction model. The interaction terms between
   time and risk factors that were significantly related to mouth opening
   were explored.
   Results: The study population consisted of 641 patients: 70.4\% male,
   mean age at baseline 62.3 years (sd 12.5). Primary tumors were
   predominantly located in the oro- and nasopharynx (25.3\%) and oral
   cavity (20.6\%). Mean mouth opening at baseline was 38.7 mm (sd 10.8).
   Six months post-RT, mean mouth opening was smallest, 36.7 mm (sd 10.0).
   In the linear mixed model analysis, mouth opening was statistically
   predicted by the location of the tumor, natural logarithm of time
   post-RT in months (Ln (months)), gender, baseline mouth opening, and
   baseline age. All main effects interacted with Ln (months).
   Conclusion: The mean mouth opening decreased slightly over time. Mouth
   opening was predicted by tumor location, time, gender, baseline mouth
   opening, and age. The model can be used to predict mouth opening. (C)

Journal = {{Communications Biology}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Chronic wounds are difficult to diagnose and characterize due to a lack
   of quantitative biomarkers. Label-free multiphoton microscopy has
   emerged as a useful imaging modality capable of quantifying changes in
   cellular metabolism using an optical redox ratio of FAD/(NADH+FAD)
   autofluorescence. However, the utility of an optical redox ratio for
   long-term in vivo monitoring of tissue metabolism has not been robustly
   evaluated. In this study, we demonstrate how multiphoton microscopy can
   be used to monitor changes in the metabolism of individual
   full-thickness skin wounds in vivo. 3D optical redox ratio maps and NADH
   fluorescence lifetime images identify differences between diabetic and
   control mice during the re-epithelialization of wounds. These metabolic
   changes are associated with a transient increase in keratinocyte
   proliferation at the wound edge. Our study demonstrates that
   high-resolution, non-invasive autofluorescence imaging can be performed
   in vivo and that optical redox ratios can serve as quantitative optical
   biomarkers of impaired wound healing.}},

Abstract = {{The ability for noninvasive visualization of functional changes of a
   tumor's oxygenation and circulatory system offers new advantages for
   prognosis and monitoring of the treatment efficacy. The results of
   breast cancer oxygen state study under chemotherapy action obtained by
   diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) in combination with Doppler
   ultrasonic imaging are presented. Complex use of optical and ultrasound
   methods gives complementary information about the size of the tumor
   node, peculiarities of its vascular bed, rate of its blood flow as well
   as oxygenation, and provide a picture of the tumor response to
   treatment. Comparison with tumor pathologic response allowed to identify
   differences in the changes of these parameters depending on the degree
   of pathological tumor response to chemotherapy. It was demonstrated that
   fourth and fifth degrees of therapeutic pathomorphism may be predicted
   by the increase of oxygen saturation level after the first cycle of
   chemotherapy. If the reduction or absence of the oxygen saturation
   dynamics is observed, first or second degree of pathological tumor
   response can be expected. Additional ultrasound investigation of the
   tumors may be useful for observation of the dynamics of tumor blood flow
   thereby for understanding the reasons of induced chemotherapy
   oxygenation changes. The proposed approach based on DOS and
   ultrasonography may be applied for monitoring of breast tumors under
   therapy and prediction of their sensitivity. (C) 2018 Society of

Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{Radiation therapy (RT) is widely used for cancer treatment, alone or in
   combination with other therapies. Recent RT advances have revived
   interest in delivering higher dose in fewer fractions, which may invoke
   both cellular and microvascular damage mechanisms. Microvasculature may
   thus be a potentially sensitive functional biomarker of RT early
   response, especially for such emerging RT treatments. However it is
   difficult to measure directly and non-invasively, and its time course,
   dose dependencies, and overall importance in tumor control are unclear.
   We use functional optical coherence tomography for quantitative
   longitudinal in vivo imaging in preclinical models of human tumor
   xenografts subjected to 10, 20 and 30 Gy doses, furnishing a detailed
   assessment of vascular remodeling following RT. Immediate (minutes to
   tens of minutes) and early (days to weeks) RT responses of microvascular
   supply, as well as tumor volume and fluorescence intensity, were
   quantified and demonstrated robust and complex temporal dose-dependent
   behaviors. The findings were compared to theoretical models proposed in
   the literature.}},

abstract="Throughout this book, the topic of order restricted inference is dealt with almost exclusively from a Bayesian perspective.
